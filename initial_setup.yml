# Initial setup for further usage.
# Add local SSH key and create the users on remote hosts (depends on the platform, may be SSH, or just
# user/password pair)
#
# NOTE: some older devices will not supprort modern SSH key encryption algorithms, so RSA-based key 
# is recommended to achieve the best compatibility.
# Please also note that in some cases there may be not possible to setup SSH public key from the
# command line using e.g. telnet, and you have to do it manually.
